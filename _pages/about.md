I am a neuroscientist interested in speech processing in the human brain. I trained at the Montreal Neurological Institute with my Ph.D. advisor Sylvain Baillet and postdoc advisor Denise Klein.

Currently I work as postdoc at the Ernst Str√ºngmann Institut in Frankfurt, Germany with David Poeppel.
